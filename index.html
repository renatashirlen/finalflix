            The ancient War of the Magi... When its flames at last receded, only
            the charred husk of a world remained. Even the power of magic was
            lost... In thousand years that followed, iron, gunpowder, and steam
            engines took the place of magic, and life slowly returned to the
            barren land... Yet there now stands one who would reawaken the magic
            of ages past, and use its dread power as a means by which to conquer
            all the world... Could anyone truly be foolish enough to repeat that
            mistake?
